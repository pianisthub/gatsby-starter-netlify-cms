 In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, an artist's isolation in their Indian home gave rise to a groundbreaking artistic endeavor. As human activity ceased, the initiative attempted to document wildlife restoration in urban areas. This project offers an insightful investigation of topics including human-animal conflict, sustainable coexistence, and Art Education Beyond Anthropocentrism. It draws influence from Michel Foucault's concept of Panopticism and employs postmodernist and posthumanist approaches. The artist set out on a creative journey, recording the movements of birds, insects, and other animals and landscapes, before after and during the lockdown using moving visuals that resembled those from a CCTV surveillance camera.
